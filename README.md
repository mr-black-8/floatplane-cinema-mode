## floatplane-cinema-mode
This is a Chrome extension to increase video player size on [floatplane.com](www.floatplane.com) similar to youtube cinema mode.

All this is doing currently is increasing the max-width of the video player container to 1920px so that 1080p video is displayed at full resolution.

I may update this to also apply a semi-opaque layer to the rest of the page for a more immersive viewing experience.
